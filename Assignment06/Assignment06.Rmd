# Add any packages you want in this chunk:
```

We are going to look at the property prices for Orange County. From there we are going to try and predict the sales price by linear regression.

# Importing Data 

Bring in the data and make sure the data types are correct. If not, make the proper changes. The file is located within this project. *data/prop_prices_reduced.csv*

```{r}

```


# Plotting

Plot histograms for all variables. Additionally, add scatterplots for the relationships between all quantitative variables.

```{r}

```

# Summary Statistics

Provide basic summary statistics for univariate analysis. Also, provide the correlation between all the quantitative variables.

```{r}

```

# Regression Analysis

Run a regression with all the variables included. Print results of the regression.

```{r}

```

Which of the variables tested significant at the 95% level? Looking at the results and answering outside of the chunk is sufficient.

## Evaluating the model

As is, are any of the Gauss-Markov assumptions violated? If so, which ones? How can you fix the issues?

```{r}

```

## New Model

Based off of your findings in the previous section, make changes to the variables, the functional form, etc.

```{r}

```


# Prediction

Based on the following inputs, predict the deflated sales price:

- 2 bed
- 2 bath
- area_heated = 1223
- area = 9750
- dist_cbd = 19368
- dist_lakes = 490
- no pool

```{r}

```
